I am thrilled to introduce **Radiant (璀光)**, a new blog theme designed for simplicity and elegance.

## Philosophy

In a world of cluttered interfaces, Radiant aims to provide a **distraction-free** reading environment. I believe that content should be the focus, but the vessel that holds it should be beautiful.

- **Simplicity**: Less is more.
- **Clarity**: Typography matters.
- **Atmosphere**: A cold, calm aesthetic.

## Getting Started

Radiant is built on top of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Content. It's fast, SEO-friendly, and easy to customize.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yuxbao/radiant-nuxt.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

I hope you enjoy using Radiant as much as I enjoyed building it.
